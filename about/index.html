				<h1 class="standard" style="text-indent: 50px;">I am a 20 year old non-binary artist/illustrator along
					with a Game Art and Design major at the Columbus College of Art and Design! A lot of work focuses on
					character concepts, design, and animation, but I also double as a programmer in HTML/JS and C#. I
					realized the best way for me to merge and combine these two passions into the best of each would be
					to make my own portfolio! So I went the extra mile and made my entire portfolio website from scratch
					and hosted it through Netlify and Github. </h1>

				<h1 class="standard" style="text-indent: 50px;">All of the work I have ever made, no matter how old, is
					something that I am proud to have made or to have learned from. Even if I have to cut it from my
					portfolio, it was still a learning experience I treasure. I think my entire site encapsulates that
					feeling. </h1>

				<h1 class="standard" style="text-indent: 50px;">The Games section, which links out to Itch.io, also
					encapsulates this feeling. Even from the shoddy prototypes, knowledge learned along the way makes it
					something I am glad to say was made by me. All of my projects help me grow and improve my skills
					each step of the way. Coding is something I really enjoy on a very visceral level, it is a lot less
					creatively inclined and a lot more like solving a really cool puzzle box, and that scratches a
					really nice itch for me. I am a 20 year old non-binary artist with a focus on character design and
					2D animation! I'm currently a junior and a Game Art and Design major at the Columbus College of Art
					and Design</h1>
