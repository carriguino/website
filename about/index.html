					I am a 21 year old non-binary artist/illustrator along
					with a Game Art and Design major at the Columbus College of Art and Design! A lot of work focuses on
					character concepts, design, and animation, but I also double as a programmer in HTML/JS and C#. I
					realized the best way for me to merge and combine these two passions into the best of each would be
					to make my own portfolio! So I went the extra mile and made my entire portfolio website from scratch
					and hosted it through Netlify and Github.



					The Games section, which links out to Itch.io, also
					encapsulates this feeling. Even from the shoddy prototypes, knowledge learned along the way makes it
					something I am glad to say was made by me. All of my projects help me grow and improve my skills
					each step of the way. Coding is something I really enjoy on a very visceral level, it is a lot less
					creatively inclined and a lot more like solving a really cool puzzle box, and that scratches a
					really nice itch for me. I am a 20 year old non-binary artist with a focus on character design and
					2D animation! I'm currently a junior and a Game Art and Design major at the Columbus College of Art
					and Design

			<tr>
				<td>
					All of the work I have ever made, no matter how old, is
					something that I am proud to have made or to have learned from. Even if I have to cut it from my
					professional portfolio, it was still a learning experience I treasure. I think my entire site
					encapsulates that
					feeling.
